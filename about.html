    <p>
      My first contact with coding took place many years ago, when I was a child
      in primary chool. I was uncomfortable with technology back then and
      couldn't understand anything! After some time I've graduated as an
      engineer of multimedia, made friends with programmers and gave coding a
      try. Nothing happened afterwards, I came back to my routines and forgot
      about it.
      <br />
      Then, in the beginning of 2022 I found SheCodes workshops. I quickly got
      into coding and started really enjoying it! I've made a huge progress and
      got to know many new technologies and tools.
